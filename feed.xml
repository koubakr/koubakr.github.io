    For my undergraduate dissertation, I engineered an acoustic levitation system based on the principles of ultrasonic standing waves. The core objective was to generate stable pressure nodes—pockets of low pressure created by constructive and destructive interference—capable of trapping and levitating light objects in mid-air.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike simple static levitators, this system employs a phased-array approach. By controlling the phase delay of individual emitters, the system creates a focused "beam" of sound.

    As the Head of Electronic Systems for the Swansea University Race Engineering (SURE) team for the 2026 Formula Student UK competition, I am responsible for the design and implementation of the vehicle's car electronics systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    My primary focus this season is integrating a new ECU as well as design and manufacturing of a new wire harness. We are also focusing on more sensors on the car to collect more data while testing, as well as refining our drive by wire and flat shifting system. We also aim to make a custom fuse box and implement a new dashboard and steering wheel system.

  <p>
    We upgraded the Electronic Control Unit to a DTA Fast T8+ ECU while retaining our proven sensors. To ensure easy manufacturing and documentation, the wiring harness was designed using RapidHarness (V1 design shown below). The professional documentation provided by the software streamlined the manufacturing and installation process, resulting in a flawless engine startup and successful track validation.
  </p>

  <p>
    To optimize engine performance, we incorporated MegaLogViewer for post-run analysis. Using real-world data logs, we fine-tuned the ignition and fuel tables to match track conditions, known as road-dyno. This calibration eliminated engine roughness, increased power delivery, and improved fuel efficiency, resulting in a highly reliable powertrain.

    For this university module project, our group designed and constructed a fully autonomous Micromouse robot. The objective was to engineer a robot capable of navigation, obstacle avoidance, and competitive combat interaction, using a Raspberry Pi Pico, two DC brushless motor with motion feedback and a set of bumper switches and a custom PCB for obstacle avoidance.

  <p>
    The Micromouse robot had the following features:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Sensor Array: We implemented a system of 4 Infrared (IR) sensors. This array allowed for accurate wall detection to sense objects to attack or avoid, depending on the mode. Four touch bar buttons where also mounted on the front and back, to detect physical contact of the robot.</li><li>Mode Selection System: We integrated a potentiometer to switch between five operating modes: Testing, Combat, Line Following, Calibration, and Obstacle Avoidance. This design choice saved space on the PCB and allowed for fast mode switching on the fly.</li><li>Audio: Using four multi-function buttons, we could control volume and audio tracks to receive real-time feedback from the actions the robot is taking.</li><li>OLED Display: We incorporated an on-board screen to provide immediate visual feedback and mode selection.</li><li>Combat : A key feature was the "Combat Push Counter." We utilized a front touch bar to detect physical collisions with other robots. Upon collision, the system would register the hit and update the count on the LCD screen, allowing us to judge performance during combat trials.</li>

    As the Head of Electronic Systems for the Swansea University Race Engineering (SURE) team for the 2025 Formula Student UK competition, I was responsible for the design and implementation of the vehicle's new car electronics. My primary focus involved integrating control systems with safety standards dictated by the rules.<br><br>ECU and Powertrain Control Central to the vehicle's management is the Haltech Elite 2500 ECU, selected for its robust documentation, reliability and reputation of the company customer support. I led the implementation of a Drive-by-Wire (DBW) system and a custom wiring harness design to ensure functionality and reliability. A key feature we focused on is the flat-shifting system for our MT-07 sequential gearbox. By utilizing an electromagnetic solenoid driven by high-current relays and controlled directly by the ECU, to achieve seamless clutchless shifting. This system automatically rev-matches via ignition cuts, significantly reducing shift times and minimizing driver error during corner exits.<br><br>I designed a comprehensive shutdown circuit compliant with FS rules to ensure driver safety during accidents or system failures. The most critical component of this system is the Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) , which I developed from scratch. Unlike standard programmable logic, this device requires a strictly hardware-based implementation. I designed a custom 2-layer PCB utilizing discrete transistor logic to monitor the throttle and brake sensors. The circuit instantly cuts power to the fuel and ignition relays if both pedals are pressed simultaneously (beyond 25% travel) or if an open-circuit fault is detected, incorporating a mandatory 10-second reset latch for fault clearance.

  <p>
    In this renovation project, I designed and implemented a Loxone smart home system. The system architecture was developed in collaboration with a licensed electrician and a certified Loxone installer. Following the design phase, I executed the physical wiring, programming, system commissioning, and troubleshooting.<br><br>The infrastructure is structured in three distribution boards: a main unit serving the ground floor and two sub-distribution boards for the upper and lower levels. The project also features complex automation for a dedicated wellness room.<br><br>Programmed via Loxone Config, the system integrates:<br>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lighting and shading (blinds)</li><li>Underfloor heating and boiler temperature control</li><li>Presence detection and intrusion alarms&nbsp;<br></li><li>Access control (Door locks, Intercom/Doorbell)</li><li>Wellness system controls (pool and sauna)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The home utilizes several logic modes to automate daily routines, to integrate into a persons life seamlessly:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Away Mode: Activates the alarm, closes blinds, turns off lights/motion detection, and lowers the temperature.</li><li>Sleep Mode: Modifies motion detection in bedrooms, dims lights, lowers temperature, closes blinds, and disables audio.</li><li>Lighting Scenes: Adapts internal brightness based on the sun's position and outdoor light intensity.</li><li>Overheating Protection: Automatically adjusts shading to block solar gain and prevent the rooms from overheating.</li>
  </ul>
