This array allowed for accurate wall detection to sense objects to attack or avoid, depending on the mode. Four touch bar buttons where also mounted on the front and back, to detect physical contact of the robot.</li><li>Mode Selection System: We integrated a potentiometer to switch between five operating modes: Testing, Combat, Line Following, Calibration, and Obstacle Avoidance. This design choice saved space on the PCB and allowed for fast mode switching on the fly.</li><li>Audio: Using four multi-function buttons, we could control volume and audio tracks to receive real-time feedback from the actions the robot is taking.</li><li>OLED Display: We incorporated an on-board screen to provide immediate visual feedback and mode selection.</li><li>Combat : A key feature was the \"Combat Push Counter.\" We utilized a front touch bar to detect physical collisions with other robots. Upon collision, the system would register the hit and update the count on the LCD screen, allowing us to judge performance during combat trials.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/7/Picture2.jpg\" height=\"179\" width=\"326\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Picture2-xs.jpg 640w ,https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Picture2-sm.jpg 768w ,https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Picture2-md.jpg 1024w ,https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Picture2-lg.jpg 1366w ,https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Picture2-xl.jpg 1600w ,https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Picture2-2xl.jpg 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>IR detection PCB</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

My primary focus involved integrating control systems with safety standards dictated by the rules.<br><br>ECU and Powertrain Control Central to the vehicle's management is the Haltech Elite 2500 ECU, selected for its robust documentation, reliability and reputation of the company customer support. I led the implementation of a Drive-by-Wire (DBW) system and a custom wiring harness design to ensure functionality and reliability. A key feature we focused on is the flat-shifting system for our MT-07 sequential gearbox. By utilizing an electromagnetic solenoid driven by high-current relays and controlled directly by the ECU, to achieve seamless clutchless shifting. This system automatically rev-matches via ignition cuts, significantly reducing shift times and minimizing driver error during corner exits.<br><br>I designed a comprehensive shutdown circuit compliant with FS rules to ensure driver safety during accidents or system failures. The most critical component of this system is the Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) , which I developed from scratch. Unlike standard programmable logic, this device requires a strictly hardware-based implementation. I designed a custom 2-layer PCB utilizing discrete transistor logic to monitor the throttle and brake sensors. The circuit instantly cuts power to the fuel and ignition relays if both pedals are pressed simultaneously (beyond 25% travel) or if an open-circuit fault is detected, incorporating a mandatory 10-second reset latch for fault clearance.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"3\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/Picture1.png\" data-size=\"827x421\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/Picture1-thumbnail.png\" height=\"367\" width=\"720\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>basic Safety Circuit diagram</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/pic.png\" data-size=\"1014x783\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/pic-thumbnail.png\" height=\"556\" width=\"720\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>BSPD PCB 3D render</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/BSPD_V5-1.png\" data-size=\"2500x1500\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/BSPD_V5-1-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"720\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>BSPD schematic</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>",
