I led the implementation of a Drive-by-Wire (DBW) system and a custom wiring harness design to ensure functionality and reliability. A key feature we focused on is the flat-shifting system for our MT-07 sequential gearbox. By utilizing an electromagnetic solenoid driven by high-current relays and controlled directly by the ECU, to achieve seamless clutchless shifting. This system automatically rev-matches via ignition cuts, significantly reducing shift times and minimizing driver error during corner exits.<br><br>I designed a comprehensive shutdown circuit compliant with FS rules to ensure driver safety during accidents or system failures. The most critical component of this system is the Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) , which I developed from scratch. Unlike standard programmable logic, this device requires a strictly hardware-based implementation. I designed a custom 2-layer PCB utilizing discrete transistor logic to monitor the throttle and brake sensors. The circuit instantly cuts power to the fuel and ignition relays if both pedals are pressed simultaneously (beyond 25% travel) or if an open-circuit fault is detected, incorporating a mandatory 10-second reset latch for fault clearance.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"3\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/Picture1.png\" data-size=\"827x421\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/Picture1-thumbnail.png\" height=\"367\" width=\"720\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>basic Safety Circuit diagram</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/pic.png\" data-size=\"1014x783\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/pic-thumbnail.png\" height=\"556\" width=\"720\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>BSPD PCB 3D render</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/BSPD_V5-1.png\" data-size=\"2500x1500\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://koubakr.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/BSPD_V5-1-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"720\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>BSPD schematic</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>",
